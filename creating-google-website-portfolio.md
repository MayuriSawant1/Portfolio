# Creating My Personalized Google Website Portfolio

### Author: Mayuri Sawant

## Introduction  
For my self-learning activity, I focused on building a personalized Google website portfolio. The portfolio’s main goal was to highlight my academic projects, certifications, and achievements. However, while working on it, I realized the importance of user interface (UI) design and basic security measures in making the portfolio both professional and safe to use. A portfolio is a digital reflection of oneself, so it must be simple, easy to navigate, and secure for visitors.

In this article, I will share the step-by-step process I followed to create my portfolio, emphasizing how I applied UI principles and fundamental security practices at each stage.

## Step 1: Planning the Layout  
Good UI design begins with structure and organization. I planned my site’s layout by considering what visitors should see first and how to avoid clutter. Instead of overwhelming users with too many pages, I chose a simple yet effective structure: a homepage and separate sections for About Me, Projects, Certifications, Achievements, and Contact. This clear organization enhances navigation, making it easier for visitors to find relevant information quickly.

## Step 2: Designing with Readability in Mind  
Designing the look and feel is crucial for UI. In Google Sites, I chose a minimalistic theme with a white background and a single accent color (blue) to keep the interface clean and professional. I selected a standard, easy-to-read font and used concise text with bullet points to improve clarity. Testing the site on both desktop and mobile confirmed the readability and responsiveness of the design.

From a security perspective, a clean and consistent design helps build trust. Visitors are more likely to engage with a site that looks authentic and well-maintained, rather than one that appears cluttered or suspicious.

## Step 3: Adding Content Securely  
While adding my work, I was careful to limit sensitive information. To protect my privacy, I only included my email address and links to professional profiles such as GitHub, along with project summaries. Avoiding personal details like my phone number or home address reduced the risk of misuse or privacy breaches while keeping the portfolio informative.

## Step 4: Navigation and User Experience  
UI design also means smooth navigation. I created a navigation bar with clear section labels visible on every page. Consistent layouts across pages helped maintain familiarity for users. I tested the site on multiple devices to ensure that switching between pages was seamless, encouraging visitors to explore more of my work without confusion.

## Step 5: Security Settings and Permissions  
Google Sites offers useful security features. I published my portfolio with permissions set to share the site only with my intended audience, such as recruiters and academic mentors. I made sure not to allow public editing to keep full control over the content. Sharing the link selectively helped maintain privacy and ensured that the portfolio was viewed only by trusted people.

## Step 6: Testing and Feedback  
Before finalizing, I tested the site from a visitor’s viewpoint, checking page load times, font clarity, and link functionality. Feedback from a classmate helped me improve usability by adding a prominent “Contact” button on the homepage. This simple UI adjustment increased user convenience and engagement.

## Real-Life Benefits I Experienced  
Building this portfolio taught me how UI design and security depend on each other. The benefits include:

- **Professional branding:** A neat design builds recruiter trust.  
- **Secure sharing:** Limiting personal data lowers security risk.  
- **Easy access:** Clear navigation allows quick scanning during interviews.  
- **Content updates:** Google Sites makes maintaining the portfolio easy and safe.

## Challenges Faced  
The hardest part was balancing design, content, and security. Initially, I added too much text, making the site look cluttered. I revised to simplify content presentation. On the security side, deciding which personal details to share without compromising privacy was tricky.

## Conclusion  
Creating a Google website portfolio is about far more than just uploading academic content. The UI design defines how professional and accessible the portfolio looks, while security choices keep it safe from potential risks. By combining these two aspects, I developed a portfolio that effectively represents me while protecting my privacy. This self-learning project highlighted that even small digital tasks benefit from thoughtful design and security practices.
